# Swift wrapper for triangle

This package is a wrapper for the [Triangle library](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) originally written in C by Jonathan Shewchuk, and inspired by the [golang port](https://github.com/pradeep-pyro/triangle) 

Features will include, but it's a work in progress right now.

 - constrained & conforming Delaunay triangulation
 - Voronoi tesselation
 - triangle mesh generation with area and angle constraints

for points in 2D.
